Ready-To-Launch-0.1
---------------

What?
-----

Ready-To-Launch is a really stupid shell script that launches
all your favourite programs when you associate with a particular network.
An example profile would be one that launches your instant messaging
clients and favourite music player upon connecting to your home network.

How?
----

On Ubuntu/Debian derivatives, simply copy the readytolaunch shell script
to /etc/network/if-up.d/. Make sure the script has 755 permissions and is
owned by user:root and group:root.

Feel free to add info here on how to go about this on other distros.
